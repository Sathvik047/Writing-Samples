# Writing-Samples
This Repo contains Few of my projects that I have worked on over the years and includes Predictive and statistical analyses using Python, R, SQL languages and also Machine Learning concepts such as (Supervised and Unsupervised Learning) 


1) Stock Prediction: https://github.com/Sathvik047/SP500-Index-Price-Prediction-Model


2)Airline Data Analysis:  https://github.com/Sathvik047/Airline-Data-Analysis


3) Verbal Vibe: This is a text to speech artistry that utilizes the Eleven Labs Text-to-Speech API to convert text into speech. It prompts the user for an API key, text input, and voice selection, and then generates an audio file with the speech output.

4) Movie Recommendation System:

This project involves building an implicit feedback recommendation system using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. The goal is to recommend artists to users based on their listening history data from Last.fm.
Technical Stack:
Python: Core language for implementation.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
SciPy: Sparse matrix operations and linear system solving.
Matplotlib: Plotting objective function values.
Pandas: Data manipulation.
This project showcases matrix factorization for recommendation systems, focusing on efficiency with sparse data.
   
5) Natural Language Processing Project:

6) 
 
6)Neural Networks Project:

7) Supervised Learning Algorrithm:

8) Social Media Project: https://github.com/Sathvik047/Finstagram
