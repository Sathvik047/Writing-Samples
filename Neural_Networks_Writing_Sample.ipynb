        "Reaching a 70% validation accuracy involves playing around with different settings for our CNN model in a methodical way. We're essentially tweaking things like how many filters it uses, the size of those filters, and how it pools information. Each change affects how the model learns and performs. For example, having more filters can help the model pick up on more detailed features, but it might also make things slower. Likewise, adjusting the filter sizes can impact whether the model focuses on tiny details or broader patterns. Plus, deciding how aggressively to pool information can affect how much detail the model retains. It's a bit like finding the right balance between studying every detail and getting the big picture. We can also update the learning rate and optimize to help with the validation accuracy.\n",

With two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers, our model adeptly captures hierarchical features from CIFAR-10 images. The choice of filter sizes and the number of filters in each layer contributes to the model's feature extraction capabilities. Utilizing max-pooling layers enhances translation invariance and computational efficiency. Training with the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.0005 for 15 epochs ensures effective parameter optimization. The model's ability to generalize is evidenced by its commendable accuracy in classifying diverse images across ten categories. Continual exploration of alternative architectures and hyperparameters may further refine the model's performance and adaptability in real-world scenarios."
